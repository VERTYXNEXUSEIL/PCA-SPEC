# Governance

## Roles
- **Owner**: ARKADIUSZ LESZO
- **Maintainers**: appointed by Owner
- **Contributors**: community participants

## Decision Model
- Normative spec changes require maintainer consensus and explicit versioning impact analysis.
- Security-sensitive changes require at least one dedicated reviewer.
- Conformance/profile changes require updates to `spec/PCA-TEST-v1.md` and vectors.

## Versioning
- `v1.x`: backward-compatible clarifications and additive features.
- `v2.0+`: potentially breaking semantic changes.
